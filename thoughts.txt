4 am : today starts great ! 2 hours work in ! loved to build retroactive
color change. added id to container on creation must not forget to comment 
on this later ! 
Actually enthousiast about my full code review + comment. 
All is going to be explained about how it works and why choices were made 

it s kinda weird because i can t wait to test all of this but i m so lazy building
a proper side bar. Was just adding random testing button so far but the 
more i add feature the less convinient it becomes.

so in order to be able to test all this sht i m working on i really need to focus on that
first of all .... coffee + smoke
then i need to think about rickrolled easter fcking eggs.

funny to see how i am really into this project even tho AI can probably
make a much better one in less than 10 minutes xD
