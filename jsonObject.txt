        need more thinking about that

    id : ,
    ownerId : ,
    accessUserId : ,
    modifyUserId : ,
    urlLink : ,
    accessPassword : ,
    content : [array filled with paths to recreate environment]
}
// desks.content need to be work on thinking about online service
// recreate environment cannot really be recreated if there is file to download in ?

object{
    id : ,
    deskid : ,
}
// maybe if files to download is stored i can load them into environment everytime user tries to access chosen desks.id 

// so what i m thinking is i m gonna manually create some of these (3 of each)
// then i ll implement function like check if you have permission before create a new folder
// using things like JSON.parse(user1).id for example.

// Am i thinking it the right way ? or did i completly misunderstood what u meant by learning localStorage concept and use
