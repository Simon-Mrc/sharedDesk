OKKKKKK SOOOOO i did spend few hours working on recursive function
to go through all currentDesk content depths and find right id to push files into

Problems was (first of all very brain demanding and try error)
and .. not working with folder because i created my code so that openning a folder
is the action that create and give id to section he is creating

So to store folder data into currentDesk data i didn t have any id to compare to 
to be able to store it into it s right parent

So i had to change script order for my section to be created at same time as folder
had to manage animations Too
encountered some issues like put a return in commentaries ...
long story short it was a great morning. learned a lot
folder and files get stored as soon as they re created.
