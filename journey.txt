//////////////////////////////////DAY 11 ///////////////////////////////////
Environment starts to look great . Fixed many many minor but important issues imported with 
database back switch . Learned a freaking lot with this project this is amazing. 
Gotta be carefull with url path and id attribution. make those clean because it s hard to track
bug appearing because of them. gonna start to work on user experience and interaction now
clearly the part i like the most but it s needed for me to be able to incorporate new functions
i want item changing color // duplicate elements // account setting // a real social interface //
But today was really a good day so far // i was a bit afraid to make the switch and honestly i ve spent
20 more or so hours just fixing and finding all bugs and at a point i felt like i wasn t gonna make it
let ' s go on !

//////////////////////////////////////DAY 10 ///////////////////////////////////////////
Finally managed it !! 60hours in 3 days but i m there ! back and front connected and (almost) working.
Desks, users, item, deskAccess currently getting stored as they re supposed to
not tested the recreation process rn.
I asked AI for a quick tree fix because it made all script crashed (too lazy to try catch everywhere)
so the routes and database i spent 30hours writing seems to work fine . 
I now really to work css and html + some functionnality (the boring part appenchild everything and create all freaking btns)
but it ll make testing easier.


So basically front handle DOM section creation and container objects for files and folder

back handles relations beetween elements, queries that alter datas (create user / create desk/ delete and so on ...)
 
i ll take a rest tonight and give all my code a full review tomorrow morning.

I ll try to write detailled explanation (also make my want to switch for typescript for next project
because you can ealisy get confused with what kind of item you re manipulating when deep in
is it a object ({name : " ",id:" " ,...})) or just a collection of parameters (name, id , ...);

anyway good enough for now . i ll put a folder of old version with no sql and only local storage because
i want to keep a trace of that work with recursive dom creation /recreation/duping/and data managment.
