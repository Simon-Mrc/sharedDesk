OMG ALMOST DONE ! can t wait to struggle implementing this.
on my mind literally all the time thinking about how to adapt my already existing process with local storage
already feelin nostalgi about all those functions i struggled with i ll hav to throw


 GET /deskAccess/:deskId    get all users of a desk
 POST /deskAccess           add user to desk
 PUT /deskAccess            change access type

and in accessQueries.js:
 addUserToDesk()
 getAllDeskUsers()
 changeAccessType()
