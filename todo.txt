#1 !!! BREAKING NEWS !!!!
Actually not a genious at all. Constructed architecture doesn t work.
looking for matching id to store created data only in first layer of depth in current desk content
need to think about how to solve this issue
will do some side work until i figure it out. Going to build duplicate function because it looks fun.


// Start work on side bar for account setting options and so o
// add color based shadow display for different user in case of shared desk 

// add function to load a environement set from generated Json file.

// Investigate zip folder download

// Investigate on how to set up an online environement
