#1 starting with checking my corrected version .
#2 fix circular import
#3 add friend // fix mock.js and modify function so it saves in local storage .
#4 build some functions to be able to set up some more options (like retroactivly changing color of all document based on builders color everytime he changes his prefered color)
#5 Build a better side bar for it to be more ready to use (and it ll allow me to build test easier.
#6 thinking about draggable but it looks like complicated code to understand and i dont want to just copy past it without understanding
